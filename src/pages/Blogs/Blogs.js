                    <ul>
                        <li>Authentication verifies who the user is.</li>
                        <li>Authentication works through passwords, one-time pins, biometric information, and other information provided or entered by the user.</li>
                        <li>Authentication is the first step of a good identity and access management process.
                            <li>Authentication is visible to and partially changeable by the user.</li>
                        </li>

                        <li>Authorization works through settings that are implemented and maintained by the organization.</li>
                        <li>Authorization always takes place after authentication.</li>
                        <li>Authorization isnâ€™t visible to or changeable by the user.</li>

                <Card.Title>Q-2 : Why are you using firebase? What other options do you have to implement authentication?</Card.Title>
                <Card.Text>
                    i am using firebase because Firebase manages all data real-time in the database.Firebase Analytics gives me undeniable insight into user behavior.Authentication by a server entails the use of a user name and password. Other ways to authenticate can be through cards, retina scans, voice recognition, and fingerprints,Multi-factor authentication,Certificate-based authentication,Token-based authentication.
